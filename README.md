Hello, I am here a new project. It is about yoloV9. When It releases a new version of YoloV9, I prepare a new project about it every time. And, I am here on a new Yolo project again. In this project, I am going to review the dataset, translate .xml to .txt format, review the new dataset, and create the train Yolo dataset. In this project, You will learn how to prepare a dataset for the yoloV9 model, train in yolov9 with the dataset you prepared, and train on a ready dataset. I prepared this project on Kagge. If You prepare this project on another platform, You can have a problem. If You write your problem in a comment, I can help you. By the way, I have a project about yolov7 and yolov8. I am going to share its links in this part. I prepared them on the Colab platform. I hope This project helps you.
